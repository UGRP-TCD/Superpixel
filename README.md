We propose a superpixel-based fast FCM (SFFCM) for color image segmentation. The proposed algorithm is able to achieve color image segmentation with a very low computational cost, yet achieve a high segmentation precision.

This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems.
